## About me
------------
My name is Evgeny, and I am a candidate for the position of frontend developer.
Over the past 8.5 years, I have been working at McDonald's and have achieved great success there, climbing the career ladder to deputy director of the director. Frontend became interested in development when he finally came to the conclusion that he was ready to change his professional trajectory: he wanted something more global, with a more convenient schedule, with the presence of space for self-realization, self-development. I decided to finish the RS school course.
As for my personal qualities, they will allow me to quickly get up to speed and establish effective activities. I consider myself a very highly motivated candidate with burning eyes.
